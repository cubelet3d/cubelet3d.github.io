MultiPass UI ongoing public testing on the Goerli network 
F12 browser console might be helpful 
Let me know if I should disable the custom right click menu for now 

Known issues:
  8bit multipass icons missing from multipass list window 
  default multipass (5.mp4) missing from multipass window when no multipass is loaded into view 
  minting the first multipass triggers out of bounds error after the UI reloads & tries to populate multipass list with the new multipass (likely goerli issue, because rinkeby was fine) 
  there are probably a lot of missing sound effects
